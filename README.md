## Overview

This is an growing list of resources, 3D-printable parts, sewing plans, and efforts to help bring more PPE to the healthcare frontline.

Many companies, individuals, and makerspaces have been working diligently with healthcare facilities and their staff to develop PPE for people on the frontline in hospitals. In addition, there are a growing list of resources for making face coverings for non-medical purposes (specifically to help prevent particulates from your own nose and mouth from potentially causing harm).

The repository serves as a growing list of different projects, processes, and open calls (proposals, challenges, etc) that are popping up all over. This is first and foremost a way for me to catalog resources I'm seeing, but I hope that a wider community can take part, expanding this list, and providing more details for those who need it.

**To be clear, I'm not a medical professional. I am attempting to list validated resources, but please use your own discretion when attempting any of these builds and get validation from local health authorities. Additionally, when creating PPE for others, please do so in a clean room environment, disinfecting before every build session, washing hands before handling items, and storing in fresh unblemished packaging for delivery to care facility.**

## :hammer: Getting Started

[Read this to set your expectations](https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-use-your-3d-printer-to-help-fight-the-coronavirus-f93edf279792). Additionally, read the PPE Playbook below, to level set what resources you have available and who you can reach out to locally to figure out priorities in your community.

Many of the projects listed below have their own steps to contribute. If you'd like to contribute to this list, please feel free to leave a pull request, or reach out to me directly. - Jeff
